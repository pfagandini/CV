    "text": "Summary\nI am a Commercial Engineer with a PhD in Economics. I am eager to leverage my academic skills to drive value and innovation in the private sector. With teaching experience in mathematics, microeconomics, finance, and macroeconomics, I developed strong analytical skills and understand the broader economic context that informs business decisions. My research has led to publications in peer-reviewed journals. During my postdoc, I enhanced my data analysis and machine learning skills by working with large datasets. In industry roles at @Pro-Chile, @ID Consulting, and @TimeWe.Tech, I’ve applied these skills to develop software for optimizing bids, create economic reports on macroeconomic trends, and forecast time series using Machine Learning. Throughout my career, I’ve consistently sought to use my coding skills to solve problems and optimize processes and drive value from data – a mindset that I believe would enable me to make a meaningful impact in any organization."
